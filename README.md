# Platos: Your Recipe Collection, Organized and Inspired

Tired of endless browser bookmarks filled with recipes you can't keep track of? Platos is the solution!  It lets you save all your favorite food recipes in one central location, eliminating the need for messy, disorganized bookmark lists that you'll eventually lose track of.

Instead of scrolling through a wall of links, Platos provides a visually appealing recipe overview. Easily find the perfect recipe with a quick glance, or get inspired when you're deciding what to make for dinner.  Seeing the images of your recipes is far more enticing than a list of website titles!
